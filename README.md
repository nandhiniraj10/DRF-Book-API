<h2>Project Abstract:</h2><br>
The Book Management API is a RESTful web service built using Django and the Django REST Framework. This API allows users to manage book records by providing endpoints for listing all books and creating new book entries. The application supports HTTP GET requests to retrieve a comprehensive list of books, returning essential details such as book ID, title, and author. Additionally, it supports POST requests to create new book records, requiring essential fields such as title and author. The API handles input validation, ensuring that necessary data is provided, and returns appropriate responses based on the success or failure of the operations. This project serves as a foundational tool for applications requiring book management capabilities, making it suitable for libraries, bookstores, or personal libraries. Future enhancements could include features like book updates, deletions, and advanced querying capabilities.
